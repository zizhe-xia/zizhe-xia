## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Zizhe Xia. Welcome to my personal site!

## Who Am I?

I am 4-th year economics PhD student at Chicago Booth. I'm interested in mechanism design and information design.

### **Screening Knowledge with Verifiable Evidence** (with [Sulagna Dasgupta](https://sites.google.com/view/sulagna))

     A principal seeks to screen an agent based on his demonstrable knowledge of a subject
matter, modeled as a binary state. The agent learns about the state through two kinds of
opposing verifiable signals, each kind providing evidence in favor of one of the states. A good
quality agent has an evidence structure which is more informative than a bad quality one. In
a symmetric setting, we show that under the optimal test, regardless of whether the agent can
predict the state correctly, he is failed if the amount of evidence he is able to show is below a
threshold. Conditional on providing evidence above this threshold, the agent is passed based on
a simple True-False test â€“ i.e., if and only if he gives the correct answer. We see this result as
rationalizing a common test structure where test-takers are given credit for giving the correct
answer only if they show a minimal amount of data, arguments, or steps, in support of their
answer. We prove the results by identifying a connection to the optimal transport problem and
leveraging it to show the existence of an appropriate virtual value function.

### **Expert Incentives under Non-Contractible States**
Abstract: I study whether and which expert incentives can be provided at what
cost when the states of the world become non-contractible, but there
is some noisy observation about the states that can be contracted
upon. A principal hires an agent to acquire costly information about
the states, but it is not possible to pay the agent based on the realized
states. Instead, the principal has access to a noisy (Blackwell) experiment
about the states, and can pay bonuses based on its realization. I
completely characterize what the principal can incentivize the agent
to learn, and how to design contracts to minimize the costs to provide
such incentives. I then study which contractible information is better
at incentive provision. Under ex ante IR, the principal can achieve
the first best cost, regardless of how noisy her information is. Under
interim IR, only qualitative information matters for costs. Under
ex post IR, quantitative information matters. I characterize novel
orders that compare experiments based on their ability to provide
incentives.
